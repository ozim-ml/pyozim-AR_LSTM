# Autoregressive Recurrent Neural Network
This repository contains code which is a little extension of the official Tensorflow tutorial https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series#advanced_autoregressive_model.
I added second AR LSTM model with smaller number of units for comparison. For comparing them I used line plots of training and validation loss and bar plots of MAE of Validation and Test datasets.
